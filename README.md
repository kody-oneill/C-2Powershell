# C-2Powershell
A quick script that will transform your Visual C# forms to powershell

You will need the ConvertForm module found here: https://github.com/LaurentDardenne/ConvertForm.
I do not own nor did I develop this module please follow the link for the most up to date version.
I will include the version I used in this tool.
I have included the original PS1 file and the EXE file that I created.

When you launch the EXE you will see this below:

The source File is the .Designer.cs file you want to convert to Powershell.

The Destination is the folder that you want the converted form to be placed. 

This does NOT delete the original .Designer.cs file it just creates a new PS1 file from it.
